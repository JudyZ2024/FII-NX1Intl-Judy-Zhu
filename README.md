NexHax Hackathon – AI & CO2 Emissions Predictor

This project uses AI predictions to look at climate change in a new way. I combined global CO2 emissions data, from 1750–2021 with real hourly data from California’s electricity grid with CAMX to estimate future growth in AI technology, as well as its energy cost, along with solutions on how to maximize energy efficiency. My goal is to connect directly to the topic UN SDG 13: Climate Action, and show how we can use the very tool that is causing global warming, to fight against it.
My project doesn't just predict future growth, but also compares classic models (linear, polynomial, exponential, logistic) with more advanced neural networks and LSTMs. Then, it takes things further by bringing up the question, what if we adjust how we use energy throughout the day? By using day vs. night data, the model estimates how much emissions could drop if people shifted demand to better hours (like relying more on solar in the afternoon or reducing AC during peak loads, and also turning off hot water after 2am). I also made an animated gif (with tutorials online) that shows emissions change across the hours of a day, compared to what we could compromise with smarter energy use.
Main features:
-Baseline comparisons of linear, polynomial, exponential, logistic, and neural net models
-An AI LSTM model forecasting for long-term emissions
-Scenario where data centers keep growing and add to CO2
-Day/night CO2 savings model using California grid data, compared to if nothing changes
-Animated daily emissions cycle that highlights where improvements can happen, and how much they can change by

How to use:

-Clone the repo and install the requirements
-Run main.py
-The code outputs graphs as pngs and an animation gif into the repo folder
-You’ll see model comparison graphs, AI forecasts, data center growth scenarios, and day/night CO2 savings projections
Why this matters:
-Predicting emissions with accuracy is essential for planning climate policies
-AI can outperform traditional models and give sharper forecasts, especially since advanced models know their techs more than users do
-Even small shifts in daily energy habits of a city can lead to huge reductions
-This connects back to SDG 13 Target 13.2, which calls for integrating climate measures into planning and action
My project shows that AI isn’t just about big futuristic technology that provides life-changing solutions, but for now, it highlights smaller, realistic adjustments in how we use energy, which adds up over time. AI isn't at the point where it can solve our climate problems itself, but using AI efficiently, humans become a key point in giving back what we’ve taken.
